                <p>
                    The first word I can say about him is smart.I loved his personality,his ethics and his love towards coding and tech Field. Whenever we are in class most of time we discuss about movies and our future after four years. He always respects my views and vice versa . His outlook on life is amazing . We spend time together because we genuinely enjoy one another’s company. We aren’t seasonal friends.His passion for work encourages me to focus on my study.I am learning lots of things from him, how to focus, adjust yourself and stand alone without expecting anything from anyone.</p>

                    From the day I met I feel something special for him,I respect him for his thoughts of his life and I'm inspired from him for his hardwork and dedication towards his goals. He is always helpful to all our friends whenever they are in trouble in understanding subject. For me he is my mentor, friend, caretaker. Has hugged me everytime life had been unfair to me saying-I am a warrior and I can get through this successfully. Things will be bright and happy again. Has told me countless stories of love, hate, empathy, dreams, lust, money, positivity -what not!
